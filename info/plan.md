Hackathon Plans
==========

Network Map
----------
 - Starts with your device, can't see anything until you root.
 - Then can see adjacent 4 network lines
 - Can fight through line to see that computer (gain access to network card)
 - Access to this card will be shut down after a while if you do not own the computer

Start
----------
Choice of mobile device
Must root to gain access
Easy - windows (less storage to start)
Normal - android (normal storage to start)
Hard - iphone (much storage to start)

Once you root your phone, you gain access to its
cpu and network - cpu gains you PRIMES for BITS while network
lets you access other computers.

Units
----------
Collecting: BITS
HP:         BITS
Crunching:  Primes
Currency:   Primes
8 BITS ~ 1 PRIME

BITS Farming
----------
Each new network connection adds to your bits per second
Watch out! If you only farm for bits you will start losing 
connections again once the cpu of the computer catches up,
unless you own that computer.

Primes Farming
----------
All turned on CPUs and GPUs will gain you primes at the current exchange rate.
Can purchase upgrade to lower exchange rate.

Quests
----------
Network Line 
 - This ends with a firewall
 - Once you have broken through the firewall 
   you will have access to that network cards network
 - This will allow you to access its adjacent computers
 - The instant you break down the firewall it will
   continue to rebuild - once rebuilt you will lose
   all networks attached to it and beyond (unless you
   own a comptuer futher from it.)
 - The firewall will stop fighting you once you take over
   the cpu of that machine.
 - It will then add to your defence (see defence)
 
 
Defence
----------
Firewall - protects you while you are fighting on the network.
Antivirus - protects you while you are fighting a cpu.

Attack
----------
Keyboard - only weapon
 - You may buy a new keyboard
 - Or you may level up the ones you currently have
  - new keyboards mean new attacks
  - old keyboards mean stronger attacks (leveled up)
 - Leveled up by use (typing skill)
 - 
 
Shutdown - maybe feature
----------
Turn off computer turns off everything, bit collection, prime calculation
as well as network card! (Are you sure you want to turn off your pc?)
